Users can choose from various criteria for their run (length, area of DC, difficulty) and see routes from the appâ€™s database that match their choices. Additionally, users can submit their own routes to the database, to be viewed and run by other users. The app will serve as a public database of running routes curated by and dedicated to DC runners. The app will save users time that they may waste in trying to plan a run and will motivate them to run more by giving them access to previously-unknown local running hotspots.</p>

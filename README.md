# DC Routes

This app offers various running routes in the Washington, DC, area. Choose which part of DC you want to run in, how far you want to run, or what type of route you want to run. You can also add your own routes to the list to help expand our database of DC running routes.

This is the client side of the app, which was built with React. Context is used to manage state throughout. Knex connects this client with its server. Smoke testing and snapshot testing are also used inside the app.

This is a fullstack app using Heroku for server hosting and Vercel for client hosting.
